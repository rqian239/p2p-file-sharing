Peer-to-peer file sharing program, emulating BitTorrent

To compile, use "javac *.java" command in src/ to create class files.

Please refer to the PeerInfo.cfg file for possible peers to run and peer-specific configs. Refer to Common.cfg for project configs (similar to metainfo file from BitTorrent).

To run a peer in a specific instance, use "java peerProcess _peerID_" in src/
