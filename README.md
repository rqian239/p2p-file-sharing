Nivedha Natarajan, Richard Qian, Sonu Venu, Revati Vijayn

This project is a peer-to-peer file sharing program similar to BitTorrent.

To run use "javac *.java" command to create class files.

Then use "java peer1 *socketnumber*" and "java peer2 *hostname* *socketnumber*" in 2 terminal instances to connect the two peers.
